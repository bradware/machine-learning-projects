All of my MDP problems (mazes) and code can be found through the RL_SIM package at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/. I ran everything through it’s GUI.
___________________________________________________
- Value Iteration: ran Value Iteration and manipulated PJOG
- Policy Iteration: ran Policy Iteration and manipulated PJOG
- Q-Learning: ran Q Learning and manipulated PJOG and epsilon
- Small Maze: Option 6 Medium_Moderate_Maze under RL_SIM/mazes
- Large Maze: Option 8 Big_Maze under RL_SIM/mazes.

I’ve included all of the screenshots of my output for running all three algorithms. Please check the appropriate directory. 

More information on RL_SIM can be found here:

I also have included an excel file with the data I used to create the tables and graphs - data.xlsx
