My datasets, clustering, and dimension reduction algorithms were all run through Weka 3.7. Here are the specific commands that I ran through Weka.
___________________________________________________
— K-means Clustering: ran SimpleKMeans
- EM Clustering: ran EM
- Principal Components Analysis: ran filter PrincipalComponents
- Independent Components Analysis: ran filter IndependentComponents
- Randomized Projections: ran filter RandomProjection
- Random Subsets: ran filter RandomSubsets
- Neural Network: ran MultilayerPerceptron

I’ve included all of my data files in this directory. Please note that the files for my kurtosis calculations and eigenvalues are in the excel file dataVisuals - PCA & ICA tab.

More information on my datasets can be found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records

However, I manipulated both of the source data sets for this project. So please run the sets that I have included for the same results. 

I also have included an excel file with the data I used to create the tables and graphs - dataVisuals.
