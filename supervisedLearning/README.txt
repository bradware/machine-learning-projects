All of my datasets were run in Weka version 3.7
___________________________________________________
— Neural Network - Multilayer Perceptron - manipulated the learning rate
- Decision Tree - J48 - manipulated the confidence factor
- Boosting - AdaBoostM1 - classifier is J48, manipulated the confidence factor and number 	of iterations
- K Nearest Neighbors - IBk - manipulated the k value
- Support Vector Machine - SMO - manipulated the kernel and the gamma value

I’ve included all of my data files in this directory.

More information on my datasets can be found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags

However, I manipulated both of the source data sets for this project. So please run the sets that I have included for the same results. 

I also have included an excel file with the data I used to create the tables and graphs.

**Note:
In the Boosting section, the data in the graph and tables are about the Correctly classified instances.
In all of the other sections, the data in the graph and tables are about the Error rates associated with classification.
