My dataset and Optimization Algorithms were all run through ABAGAIL: https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL. Here are the specific files that I ran through ABAGAIL.
___________________________________________________
— WineQualityTest.java - to run my wine dataset and use optimization algorithms instead of backpropagation. File is attached.
- FourPeaksTest.java - used to run Four Peaks problem. File is attached. 
- KnapsackTest.java - used to run Knapsack problem. File is attached. 
- TravelingSalesmanTest.java - used to run Traveling Salesman problem. File is attached. 

I’ve included all of my data files in this directory.

More information on my datasets can be found here:

However, I manipulated both of the source data sets for this project. So please run the sets that I have included for the same results. 

I also have included an excel file with the data I used to create the tables and graphs.
